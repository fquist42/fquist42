# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Fabian Quist, a german ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª student @42Heilbronn in Germany who is learning a lot of new stuff everyday to become a good and reliable problem-solver!

Intra: Fquist |
Coalition: Area 42 :alien:
<br>(Fyi: This School is awesome, go check it out.)

## Current plans:

My project "42 Heilbronn" will be available under "projects" and will be constantly expanded and updated.
The project will be divided into 3 parts, which contains all my projects that I want to achieve during the **core curriculum**, the **internship** and the following **specialisation phase** (subject to change). The repositories of the individual projects will be published and linked to the project as soon as I have passed the tests. Non-related 42 projects are kept separate.

 ## Project status:
 
- ***Libft*** is under evaluation.
- Next Project: ***Born2beRoot***
